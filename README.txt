The GymFit Management System is one of the systems which helps the administration in
speeding up the tasks at the same time reducing the complexity.

The purpose or objective of this system is to digitalize and create an automated system. The
system will perform the task like adding the new member to the gym, updating the member
information, monitors attendance, assign gym schedule and other stuff required in managing
the gym properly.

The present scenario in the gyms is that the records are kept by writing in a file on the paper.
Every management task is done manually. This creates a system unreliable and confusing to
keep the correct track of the records.

The maintenance of the system like this is hardly required until it needs to change any part of
the system. The information about the various things contained in the system are like
members, trainers, equipment can get by just a few clicks unlike the paper documents
required the serious reading for such information.

It helps in creating the various batch according to their preference or if they want a particular
trainer. It made easy to generate the reports of various operations performed in the gym are
like paying the fee it can be stored and later evaluated and get the list of members who did
not pay the fee.

It also helps the users in reducing the carbon footprint as the amount of paper used in
company reduces.

This also helps in keeping the standard width of the management system as if there is a case
where the administration involves more than one person to manage the gym.

This system does not only limit itself to the administration and but also helps the members of
the gym. The members can have options like attendance, assign gym schedule and diet
schedule.

This will improve the transparency between the members which is always a good quality in
the system. It will also give the layer of security to the administration and the users that only
authorized users can access by their credentials.
